# Graph coloring problem - evolution algorithm
Set of files made while following the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (WstÄ™p do Sztucznej Inteligencji). Project includes generating graph, finding correct way of coloring the graph using as little colors as possible and displaying the graph.

### Graph coloring problem
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Vertex_coloring):

In graph theory, graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling; it is an assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. **In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color;** this is called a vertex coloring.
